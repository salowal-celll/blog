Coined by legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, the term *intersectionality* describes how different aspects of a person's social and political identities combine to create unique modes of discrimination and privilege. 

In mental health care, operating without an intersectional lens means treating a person as a single facet, rather than a whole human being with complex, intersecting experiences. 

## The Missing Pieces in Standard Therapy

Standard therapeutic models often analyze issues through a singular lens—typically prioritizing a white, middle-class, heterosexual framework. This means that a Black woman seeking therapy might find her therapist addressing her stress primarily as a gender issue, completely missing the compounded reality of both misogyny and racism (misogynoir) she faces daily.

## Why Intersectionality Matters in Treatment

When therapy is not intersectional:

1. **Misdiagnosis:** Symptoms of systemic oppression, such as hypervigilance or chronic exhaustion, can be mislabeled as individual pathology.
2. **Alienation:** The client may feel they have to "leave parts of themselves at the door" to be understood by their therapist.
3. **Ineffective Coping Strategies:** Advice that works for someone with systemic privilege (e.g., "just speak up more in meetings") might be physically or professionally dangerous for someone facing multiple intersecting prejudices.

## Culturally Sensitive Practice

A culturally sensitive therapist views you holistically. They do not rank your race against your gender or class; they understand the intricate web these form. By naming these intersecting forces, therapy moves from isolated coping to genuine empowerment.
