Microaggressions—the everyday, subtle, intentional or unintentional interactions or behaviors that communicate bias toward marginalized groups—are a pervasive issue in modern workplaces. They might seem harmless to the perpetrator, but the cumulative effect on the recipient is profound and deeply exhausting.

## What Do Microaggressions Look Like?

Often disguised as compliments or casual remarks, microaggressions can include comments like:
- "You're so articulate for someone of your background."
- "Where are you *really* from?"
- Consistently mispronouncing a colleague’s name after being corrected.
- Treating someone as invisible during important meetings.

These instances may appear trivial in isolation, but they often signal an underlying prejudice and can result in "death by a thousand cuts" for the individual on the receiving end.

## The Mental Toll

The psychological impact of workplace microaggressions is significant. Employees from ethnic minorities may experience heightened anxiety, imposter syndrome, and burnout. Constantly navigating these subtle slights requires immense emotional labor, detracting from their actual work and diminishing overall career satisfaction.

## How to Navigate and Respond

If you are on the receiving end:
1. **Assess Your Safety:** You aren’t obligated to address every microaggression in the moment. Protect your peace first.
2. **Clarify and Question:** Sometimes asking, "What did you mean by that?" forces the speaker to reflect on the subconscious bias of their statement.
3. **Seek Support:** Connect with Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) or trusted colleagues.

If you are a manager or ally:
1. **Listen Without Defensiveness:** When someone points out a microaggression, do not invalidate their feelings. Apologize for the impact.
2. **Educate Yourself:** Do not rely on marginalized individuals to teach you. Read, engage with EDI resources, and be proactive.
3. **Call It Out:** Use your privilege to intercept microaggressions when they occur during team interactions.

Creating an inclusive environment demands that we look beyond overt discrimination and actively dismantle the microaggressions that quietly erode workplace culture.
