Many organisations respond to calls for racial justice by booking a one-off diversity training session. While well-intentioned, this approach rarely creates lasting change.

## The Problem with One-Off Training

Research consistently shows that single awareness sessions:

- Often increase awareness but don't change behaviour
- Can trigger defensiveness rather than reflection
- May leave marginalised staff feeling more vulnerable
- Don't address systemic issues in policies and culture

Staff from ethnic minorities often report that after these sessions, they're expected to feel better while nothing has actually changed.

## What Meaningful Anti-Racism Work Looks Like

Effective anti-racism requires sustained effort across multiple areas:

### 1. Leadership Commitment

Anti-racism must be led from the top. Leaders need to:

- Publicly commit to anti-racist goals
- Allocate resources for ongoing work
- Be willing to hear uncomfortable truths
- Model reflective practice

### 2. Policy Review

Examine your policies through an anti-racist lens:

- Recruitment and promotion processes
- Grievance and complaints procedures
- Performance management
- Wellbeing and support offers

### 3. Staff Support

Create genuine support for staff from ethnic minorities:

- Safe spaces and staff networks
- Access to culturally sensitive support
- Clear pathways for raising concerns
- Protection from retaliation

### 4. Ongoing Learning

Replace one-off sessions with:

- Regular facilitated discussions
- Action learning sets for managers
- External consultancy and challenge
- Regular review of progress

## Getting Started

If your organisation is ready to move beyond performative gestures, start by:

1. Listening to staff from ethnic minorities about their experiences
2. Being honest about where you are now
3. Setting realistic, measurable goals
4. Committing resources for the long term
