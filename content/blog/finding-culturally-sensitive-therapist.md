Finding the right therapist can be challenging, especially if you're looking for someone who understands your cultural background, identity, and lived experiences.

## Why Cultural Sensitivity Matters

Many people from ethnic minorities report feeling misunderstood or unseen in therapy. This can happen when therapists:

- Don't understand the impact of racism and microaggressions
- Make assumptions based on stereotypes
- Dismiss cultural or religious practices
- Focus only on individual psychology without considering social context

A culturally sensitive therapist will take your whole story seriously, including experiences of racism, migration, faith, culture, and community.

## Questions to Ask a Potential Therapist

Before starting therapy, consider asking:

1. **What experience do you have working with people from my background?**
2. **How do you approach conversations about race and culture in therapy?**
3. **What training have you had in culturally sensitive practice?**
4. **How would you handle it if I felt misunderstood?**

## Red Flags to Watch For

Be cautious if a therapist:

- Dismisses or minimises your experiences of racism
- Claims to be "colour-blind" or treat everyone "the same"
- Seems uncomfortable discussing race or culture
- Makes assumptions about your beliefs or values

## What to Expect From Your First Session

In a good first session, you should feel:

- Heard and understood
- Able to ask questions
- That your therapist is curious about your experiences
- Safe to share at your own pace

Remember, it's okay to try a few therapists before finding the right fit. Your comfort and sense of being understood are essential for effective therapy.
