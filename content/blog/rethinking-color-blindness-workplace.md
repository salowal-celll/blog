"I don't see color; I just see people." 

This statement, often delivered with good intentions, is a common refrain in corporate environments aiming for equality. The idea behind 'color-blindness' is that by ignoring racial differences, discrimination will disappear. However, for ethnic minority employees, this philosophy achieves the exact opposite: it invalidates their reality.

## The Flaw of 'Color-Blindness'

When managers or colleagues claim they don't see color, they are effectively saying they do not see the unique advantages or disadvantages associated with race in our society. 

1. **Erasure of Identity:** Race and culture shape how individuals experience the world, including the workplace. Denying these identities erases a significant part of who a person is.
2. **Ignoring Systemic Barriers:** Treating everyone identically assumes everyone starts from the same level playing field, ignoring structural racism, differing educational opportunities, and unconscious biases in hiring and promotion.
3. **Invalidating Experiences of Racism:** When an employee faces race-based microaggressions, a 'color-blind' culture makes it incredibly difficult for them to safely articulate the problem, as the organization claims race is irrelevant.

## Shifting to Color-Consciousness

A truly inclusive workplace moves from color-blindness to color-consciousness. This involves:

- **Acknowledging Differences:** Actively recognize that people have different lived experiences based on their racial and cultural backgrounds.
- **Proactive Empathy:** Understand that an employee of color may be navigating invisible burdens outside and inside the office that their white peers are not.
- **Tailored Support:** Designing mentoring, support, and mental health resources that address the specific needs of diverse groups, rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all approach.

Anti-racism is an active process. We cannot dismantle the systemic barriers in our workplaces by pretending they do not exist.
