Allyship in the corporate world is frequently misunderstood. Often, it begins and ends with adding a diversity hashtag to a LinkedIn post or attending a yearly unconscious bias training. While awareness is a starting point, it is not the destination. 

True allyship requires action, regular self-reflection, and a willingness to leverage your privilege to alter the status quo for marginalized colleagues.

## Recognizing Performative Allyship

Performative allyship centers the ally, not the marginalized group. It occurs when actions are taken primarily for social capital or to maintain a positive self-image. Examples include:

- Posting supportive messages publicly while remaining silent during private executive meetings where diversity is deprioritized.
- Over-apologizing when corrected on a microaggression, forcing the marginalized person to comfort the offender.

## Moving to Active Allyship

Active allyship is an ongoing verb. It requires:

1. **Amplification:** Use your platform to elevate the voices of ethnic minority colleagues. When they share an idea that is overlooked, reiterate it and attribute it to them.
2. **Educating Yourself:** Do the heavy lifting of understanding systemic racism. Read, listen, and learn without expecting your marginalized peers to be your teachers.
3. **Interrupting Bias:** When you witness a microaggression, interrupt it. Say, "I don't think that was appropriate," or "Let's let [Name] finish their point."
4. **Sponsorship over Mentorship:** Mentorship is giving advice; sponsorship is using your influence to put someone's name in a room full of opportunities.

Anti-racist allyship is inherently uncomfortable because it requires challenging the systems that benefit you. However, without it, the burden of systemic change rests solely on the shoulders of those already marginalized by it.
