Racial trauma, or race-based traumatic stress, refers to the mental and emotional injury caused by encounters with racial bias, discrimination, and hate crimes. 

Unlike a single traumatic event, racial trauma is often chronic and cumulative. It comes from the news cycle, structural inequalities, and daily microaggressions. Because the stressor (systemic racism) is ongoing, standard "self-care" advice like taking a bubble bath or going for a walk often feels deeply inadequate.

## Grounding Strategies

When the weight of racial trauma feels overwhelming, immediate grounding techniques can help regulate your nervous system:

- **Limit News Consumption:** It is not your responsibility to bear witness to every traumatic event affecting your community. Setting strict boundaries on your media consumption is an act of self-preservation.
- **Breathwork:** Deep, diaphragmatic breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, signaling to your body that it is safe to rest.
- **Connect with Your Body:** Trauma frequently disconnects us from our physical selves. Finding movement that brings you joy—whether dancing, walking, or stretching—can help release stored tension.

## Community as Care

Self-care isn't solely an individual pursuit; it is often communal.
- **Seek Safe Spaces:** Surround yourself with people who instantly understand your reality without requiring you to explain, translate, or justify your feelings.
- **Collective Grieving:** Sometimes, the most powerful coping mechanism is acknowledging the shared pain within a community rather than isolating it.

## Professional Support

Therapy is a vital form of self-care. It’s essential, however, to work with a practitioner who is fluent in the impact of racial trauma. A therapist should not require you to educate them on the realities of systemic racism before they can help you heal.
