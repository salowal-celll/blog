a:T960,<p>Many organisations respond to calls for racial justice by booking a one-off diversity training session. While well-intentioned, this approach rarely creates lasting change.</p>
<h2>The Problem with One-Off Training</h2>
<p>Research consistently shows that single awareness sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often increase awareness but don't change behaviour</li>
<li>Can trigger defensiveness rather than reflection</li>
<li>May leave marginalised staff feeling more vulnerable</li>
<li>Don't address systemic issues in policies and culture</li>
</ul>
<p>Staff from ethnic minorities often report that after these sessions, they're expected to feel better while nothing has actually changed.</p>
<h2>What Meaningful Anti-Racism Work Looks Like</h2>
<p>Effective anti-racism requires sustained effort across multiple areas:</p>
<h3>1. Leadership Commitment</h3>
<p>Anti-racism must be led from the top. Leaders need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publicly commit to anti-racist goals</li>
<li>Allocate resources for ongoing work</li>
<li>Be willing to hear uncomfortable truths</li>
<li>Model reflective practice</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Policy Review</h3>
<p>Examine your policies through an anti-racist lens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recruitment and promotion processes</li>
<li>Grievance and complaints procedures</li>
<li>Performance management</li>
<li>Wellbeing and support offers</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Staff Support</h3>
<p>Create genuine support for staff from ethnic minorities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe spaces and staff networks</li>
<li>Access to culturally sensitive support</li>
<li>Clear pathways for raising concerns</li>
<li>Protection from retaliation</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Ongoing Learning</h3>
<p>Replace one-off sessions with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular facilitated discussions</li>
<li>Action learning sets for managers</li>
<li>External consultancy and challenge</li>
<li>Regular review of progress</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>If your organisation is ready to move beyond performative gestures, start by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Listening to staff from ethnic minorities about their experiences</li>
<li>Being honest about where you are now</li>
<li>Setting realistic, measurable goals</li>
<li>Committing resources for the long term</li>
</ol>
