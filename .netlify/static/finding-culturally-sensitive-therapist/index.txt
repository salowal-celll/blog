a:T853,<p>Finding the right therapist can be challenging, especially if you're looking for someone who understands your cultural background, identity, and lived experiences.</p>
<h2>Why Cultural Sensitivity Matters</h2>
<p>Many people from ethnic minorities report feeling misunderstood or unseen in therapy. This can happen when therapists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't understand the impact of racism and microaggressions</li>
<li>Make assumptions based on stereotypes</li>
<li>Dismiss cultural or religious practices</li>
<li>Focus only on individual psychology without considering social context</li>
</ul>
<p>A culturally sensitive therapist will take your whole story seriously, including experiences of racism, migration, faith, culture, and community.</p>
<h2>Questions to Ask a Potential Therapist</h2>
<p>Before starting therapy, consider asking:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What experience do you have working with people from my background?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How do you approach conversations about race and culture in therapy?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What training have you had in culturally sensitive practice?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How would you handle it if I felt misunderstood?</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
<p>Be cautious if a therapist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dismisses or minimises your experiences of racism</li>
<li>Claims to be "colour-blind" or treat everyone "the same"</li>
<li>Seems uncomfortable discussing race or culture</li>
<li>Makes assumptions about your beliefs or values</li>
</ul>
<h2>What to Expect From Your First Session</h2>
<p>In a good first session, you should feel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heard and understood</li>
<li>Able to ask questions</li>
<li>That your therapist is curious about your experiences</li>
<li>Safe to share at your own pace</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, it's okay to try a few therapists before finding the right fit. Your comfort and sense of being understood are essential for effective therapy.</p>
